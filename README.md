# INTERNSHIP

## King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) - Data Scientist
_12/2022 - 05/2023_

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a raster-based dataset encompassing spatio-temporal information on forest fires in the Amazon from 2001 to 2020. Utilized **R** and key packages such as `terra`, `raster`, and `h2o` for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and ensemble modeling. <br/>
**Key Contributions:** <br/>
 ■	**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted exploratory analysis on a high-resolution dataset (500m) with ten variables, capturing factors related to fires, land use, environment, and climate. <br/> 
 ■	**Class Imbalance and Missing Data:** Addressed class imbalance and missing data challenges, significantly improving model performance. <br/>
 ■	**Data Downsampling:** Implemented a down-sampling approach, reducing the dataset to 550 million observations, and dividing it into 11 zones for improved efficiency.<br/>
 ■	**Machine Learning Models:** Developed and evaluated machine learning models such as Distributed Random Forest (**DRF**), Generalized Linear Models (**GLM**), Gradient Boosting Machines (**GBM**), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (**XGB**). <br/>
 ■	**Ensemble Modeling:** Created an ensemble model by combining the strengths of individual models within each zone, enhancing predictive accuracy, leveraging AUC and AUCPR metrics. <br/>
 ■	**Visualization:** Visualized the results through dynamic monthly maps and time trend charts, providing insights into fire probabilities in the Amazon over the 20-year period. <br/>
**Tools:** Executed the project using **R** and employed various packages, including `terra`, `raster`, `h2o`, `rsample`, `recipes`, `data.table`, `tidyverse`, `pROC`, `doParallel`, `doSNOW`, `ggplot2`, `tidyterra`.
