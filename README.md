## INTERNSHIP

### King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) - Data Scientist
_12/2022 - 05/2023_

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a raster-based dataset encompassing spatio-temporal information on forest fires in the Amazon from 2001 to 2020. Utilized R and key packages such as terra, raster, and h2o for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and ensemble modeling.
Key Contributions:
 ■	Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory analysis on a high-resolution dataset (500m) with ten variables, capturing factors related to fires, land use, environment, and climate.
 ■	Class Imbalance and Missing Data: Addressed class imbalance and missing data challenges, significantly improving model performance.
 ■	Data Downsampling: Implemented a down-sampling approach, reducing the dataset to 550 million observations, and dividing it into 11 zones for improved efficiency.
 ■	Machine Learning Models: Developed and evaluated machine learning models such as Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
 ■	Ensemble Modeling: Created an ensemble model by combining the strengths of individual models within each zone, enhancing predictive accuracy, leveraging AUC and AUCPR metrics.
 ■	Visualization: Visualized the results through dynamic monthly maps and time trend charts, providing insights into fire probabilities in the Amazon over the 20-year period.
Tools: Executed the project using R and employed various packages, including terra, raster, h2o, rsample, recipes, data.table, tidyverse, pROC, doParallel, doSNOW, ggplot2, tidyterra.
